# Personalised-strategy-updates-facilitate-the-emergence-of-cooperation-in-heterogeneous-populations


Code for the paper "Personalised strategy updates facilitate the emergence of cooperation in heterogeneous populations".

The code includes the function:

- `getBCratioRateUniIni` to calculate the theoretical critical ratio C* shown in Eq. (1) in the main text, where the evolutionary game process starts from a single cooperator placed uniformly at random on the network;
- `OptUpRat` to optimize the update rate for each individual given the adjacent matrix of any network;
- `bcrRateApprox` to calculate the theoretical approximation shown in Eq. (3) in the main text.

The function of each file is depicted at the beginning of each file.

All codes are written by MathWorks Matlab R2021a.

To run the code, make sure that all files are in the same folder.
